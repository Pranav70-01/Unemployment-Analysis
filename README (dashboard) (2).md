## Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends in India using two real-world datasets:
- `Unemployment in India.csv`
- `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`

The goal is to explore how unemployment rates have changed over time and across different states, and to visualize these patterns to gain actionable insights.
## Objectives
- Understand regional and temporal variations in unemployment rates
- Identify trends and spikes during key periods (e.g., COVID-19 lockdowns)
- Present findings through clear, interactive, and static visualizations
## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Plotly** – interactive charts

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and cleaned datasets for consistency
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized trends using:
  - Bar plots
  - Line charts
  - Heatmaps
- Highlighted key patterns in unemployment rates across time and regions

## Key Insights
- Noticeable spikes in unemployment rates during events like the COVID-19 lockdowns
- Significant differences in unemployment rates across different Indian states
- Visual analytics help transform raw data into accessible, meaningful insights.
